	<h2>  Where they came from </h2>

		<h4> Since forming in Stillwater, Oklahoma, in 1999, the group have released four albums, 
		numerous hit singles such as “Swing, Swing” and “Dirty Little Secret” and toured alongside 
		everyone from Blink-182 to Bon Jovi. The band consists of lead vocalist and bassist Tyson Ritter, lead guitarist and 
		backing vocalist Nick Wheeler, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Mike Kennerty, and drummer Chris Gaylor. Wheeler 
		and Ritter serve as the band's songwriters; Wheeler is the primary composer and Ritter is the primary lyricist. Although 
		Kennerty and Gaylor are not founding members, they have appeared in all of the band's music videos and on all studio 
		releases except for the band's self-titled debut.</h4>

		<h2>  What's Next </h2>

		<h5> Having been a part of the major label system for almost their entire career, there's 
		something inherently liberating about the band embarking on the latest phase of their career 
		with a new label, no management, and a fresh slate. So what's next for The All-American Rejects? 
		“I don't know, “ Ritter responds, “but I think it's the not knowing that's exciting. A lot of our 
		contemporaries make a big deal to break up, and we get it, it's probably good for their psyche to 
		draw a line in the sand, but we're never gonna do that,” he summarizes. “As much as we might have 
		going on in our lives, the one thing that we can all agree on with The All-American Rejects is that
		we're never gonna stop doing this.” <h5>
